Collective variables module (Colvars)
=======

A software module for molecular simulation and analysis programs that provides a flexible and high-performance platform for present and future algorithms.

The source code and binary are also distributed together with the simulation programs [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/) and [LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov/) and the visualization program [VMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).

To recompile each program with the most recent version of the module, [download](https://github.com/colvars/colvars/archive/master.zip) the `master` branch of this repository, or clone it via git:
```
git clone https://github.com/colvars/colvars.git
```
and run the provided `update-colvars-code.sh` script against the unpacked source tree of each program:
```
./update-colvars-code.sh /path/to/NAMD_X.YY_Source ; # updates NAMD
./update-colvars-code.sh /path/to/vmd-X.Y.Z        ; # updates VMD
./update-colvars-code.sh /path/to/lammps-XXyyyZZ   ; # updates LAMMPS
```
The update script is synchronized with the latest version of each program: [NAMD nightly build](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=NAMD), [VMD CVS](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/doxygen/cvsget.html) and [LAMMPS development version](http://www.lammps.org/).

All bugfixes are released through the `master` branch, which is to be considered the "*stable*" release. 

Other branches are dedicated to the development of specific features: use them at your own discretion.

Please use the "Issues" tab of this page to submit new bug reports or to suggest new features.
